/*  DYNAMIC PROG
    Optimization. Richard Bellman 1953.
    Complicated problems can be broken down into smaller sub-problems in a recursive manner.
    After finding solutions for the sub-problems, the sub-results combine to form the final solution.
    For overlapping sub-problems.

    Optimal substructure: Construct optimal solution from optimal sub-solutions.
    Bellman Equation: Relationship between the sub-results and the final result.
