/*  BACKTRACKING - DFS
> Form of recursion. General algo to find all solutions to some computational problems.
Constraint-satisfaction problems. Combinatorial optimization problems.
N-queens problem, Sudoku
In brute force I consider and evaluate all possible solutions.
In backtracking I can discard several bad states with one iteration.
Tree structures: Game trees / Potential search trees.
 */

/*  NP-Complete problem Problem
    Reduce brute force O(N!) to exponential running time with backtracking for the N-Queens problem.
    Coloring problem can be reduced to exponential running time as well.
    EXPONENTIAL RUNNING TIME IS VERY SLOW
    Non-applicable to real world applications
    NP-Complete, NP-Hard problems have very high number of possible states, so exponential solutions
    are out of the question.
    Meta heuristics: Find approximation instead. AI.
    Genetics algos,simulated annealing, ant colony optimization.
