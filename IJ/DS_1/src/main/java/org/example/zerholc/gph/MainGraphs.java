/* Graphs - Directed / Undirected
/  V Vertices and E Edges
/  1. Adjacency matrices: A(i,j) = 1 if there is a connection between i and j. Otherwise 0.
/  Diagonal is 0 for non-recurrent graphs.
/  2. Edge list representation: Vertex class:
/  T data; boolean visited; Vertex[] neighbours;
**/

/* Applications
/  1. Shortest path algos: GPS, high frequency trading
/  2. Graph traversing: web crawlers
/  3. Spanning trees
/  4. Maximum flow problems
/  5. When Google's graph algos are array based they require matrix related operations.
