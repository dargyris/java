/* TDD: Test Driven Development
/  I first write the unit tests about the important functionality of my code
/  And AFTERWARDS I begin with writing the code.
**/

/* Unit Testing Principles
/  1. Easy to understand: 15 seconds to read.
/  NAMING: multiply_twoPositiveValues_producesPositiveValue()
/  transferMoney_insufficientFunds_throwsException
/  VALUES: Highlight values that are important
/  ONE CONDITION: One condition per test.
/  2. Fail only when there is a problem with production code.
/  3. Should find ALL problems in the production code.
/  4. Minimize duplication
/  5. Should run quickly.
**/

/* Tips
/  1. Unlearn! Bad practices and habits.
/  2. Takes time 2-3 months
/  3. Mentor! Team.
**/

/* 3 STEPS
/  1. RED: Simple test that fails
/  2. GREEN: Write simple code to make it succeed
/  3. REFACTOR: Make the code adgere to the 4 principles of simple design.
**/


/* 3 Laws to TDD
/  1. No production code without failing tests
/  2. Progressively more complex tests and code. Start from simple.
/  3. Just enough code to make the test pass.
/  4. 2 minutes: A cycle should be done within 2 minutes!
